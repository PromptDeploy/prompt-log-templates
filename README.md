# Prompt Log Templates

A collection of high-signal templates for logging prompts that actually work — so your dev workflow gets smarter with every task.

This repo is part of [Prompt/Deploy](https://prompt-deploy.beehiiv.com/), where we build real-world, AI-native systems for modern software engineers.

## Why Use Prompt Logs?

Most prompts disappear in chat logs.

But some are worth saving — because they:

- Solved a real problem
- Saved serious time
- Revealed a reusable pattern

Prompt logs give you a lightweight, structured way to build your “AI memory.” You’ll reuse, refine, and scale what works — instead of guessing every time.

## 💡 Best Practices

- Log only the prompts worth remembering
- Focus on **impact**, not perfection
- Add reuse scores and outcome notes — they’ll pay off later
- Treat your prompt log like a personal toolkit, not a report card
